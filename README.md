Smiley is a pipeline to generate threat description reports for malware families.

## Threat Intelligence Pipeline Automation

For threat intelligence tasks we need a fast and easy way to sample from our databases and build a *malware zoo* of samples :

* Provide a taxonomy of malware families, such a taxonomy would be similar to this :

  * Malware family name
  * TTP About the malware
  * Links to saferwall scan reports
  * Short history about the family + links to other 

An example of a family taxonomy would be something similar to this :

```sh

* Gamarue
* First appearance 2011
* Static Scan reports :
  * https://saferwall.com/scan/static/variant-1-xxxx
  * https://saferwall.com/scan/static/variant-2-xxxx
* Dynamic Scan reports :
  * https://saferwall.com/scan/dynamic/variant-1-xxxx
  * https://saferwall.com/scan/static/variant-2-xxxx
* Known behavior and TTOP :
  * Creates registry key "xxxxxxxx"
  * Injects into process "xxxxxxx"

```

The taxonomy reports will be published using Markdown format a sample template will be used to construct reports for each family.
